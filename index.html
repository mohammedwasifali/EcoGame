            <p>Our planet has survived five mass extinctions, each reshaping life forever. Dinosaurs once ruled Earth for over 165 million years, yet they are now only a memory. In comparison, modern humans have existed for less than 1% of that time‚Äîjust
                a blink in Earth‚Äôs history.</p>
            <p>In only a few hundred years, humanity has built incredible civilizations, invented amazing technologies, and reached the stars. But in the process, we have also harmed the very home that makes all of this possible‚Äîour one and only Earth.</p>
            <p>Remember: there is no Planet B. The choices we make today will decide whether Earth continues to thrive for millions of years more, or whether our story ends too soon.</p>
